# ViewController
A View Controller for Zenject

Please note: This project is setup to be compiled into a DLL, but can be used directly in Unity. Copy the ViewController folder directly to Unity and also add Zenject 4.

To use as a DLL, add the UnityEngine.dll to the Libraries folder, then open the ViewController.sln file.

For usage, check out my blog post: http://blog.jamjardavies.co.uk/index.php/2016/04/12/view-controller-with-zenject/
